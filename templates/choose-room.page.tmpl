                    Here we create a variable to use in this view $rooms from an index called .Data
                    which is passed by default to every Go template whenever data is passed to a view.
                    We can the do anything with that data stored in the variable (in this case $rooms), 
                    so here we choose to range through the data. For the ranging to work, we just have 
                    to make sure that the rooms variable we're passing into the template is a slice or 
                    array of structs (e.g., a []Room type), where each struct has a field named RoomName
                */}}
